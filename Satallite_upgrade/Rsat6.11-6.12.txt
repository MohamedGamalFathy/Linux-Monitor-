Notes
=====
- If the Satellite 6.12 repositories are not visible in your Satellite,
In the Satellite web UI, navigate to Content > Subscriptions, and then click Manage Manifest.
In the Subscription Manifest pane, click Refresh to download the latest copy of the Subscription Manifest.

- If an error occurs when you try to synchronize a repository, refresh the manifest. If the problem persists, raise a support request. 
Do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the Satellite web UI; this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.
